## Function Naming Conventions
-Ex suffix
	An updated function, where the new is not compatible with the old one. (Microsoft keeps supporting old functions.)
-A, -W suffix
	These functions take strings as parameters, and there's two versions of it - one for ASCI.
	**DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE DOCS** - drop it if searching for it.
