### Static Linking
PE file header doesn't show the file contains linked code - the code from the libraries is copied into the executable.
Least common, although common in unix/linux executables.

### Runtime Linking
Executables connect to libraries only when they need a function from it - not at the start (unlike dynamically linked programs).

>Windows has some functions that allow importing linked functions *not* listed in the header :)
