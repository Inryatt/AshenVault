### Static Linking
PE file header doesn't show the file contains linked code - the code from the libraries is copied into the executable.
Least common, although common in unix/linux executables.

### Runtime Linking
Executables connect to libraries only when they need a function from it - not at the start (unlike dynamically linked programs).

>Windows has some functions that allow importing linked functions *not* listed in the header :)

>>**LoadLibrary
>>GetProcAddress**
>>	Allow program to access any function/lib in the system - can't tell statically which ones.
>>LdrGetProcAddress
>>LdrLoadDll

### Dynamic Linking
When program is loaded, the dynamic libraries are searched for - the called functions execute from within the library.
Information on every library  that'll be loaded and function that'll be executed is stored in the **PE Header**.
