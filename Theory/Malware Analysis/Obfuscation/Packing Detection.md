- Malware that's packed/obfuscated contains very few strings - if analysis via `strings` yields few results, it's likely been obfuscated.

**GetProcAddress**, which are used to load and gain access to additional functions.

A wrapper is used to decompress and run the packed file. When analysed (statically), only this wrapper can be dissected.
